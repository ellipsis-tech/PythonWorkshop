    "## Why Learn Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Learn:** Python's syntax is simple and readable, making it a great first programming language.\n",
    "- **Versatile:** Used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "- **Community:** Large, supportive community with plenty of resources.\n",
    "***\n",
    "## What You'll Need\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "2. **IDE:** An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) helps you write code. \n",
    "   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to run your first program\n",
    "1. Open your IDE.\n",
    "2. Create a new file and save it with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py).\n",
    "3. Begin writing code in the file!\n",
